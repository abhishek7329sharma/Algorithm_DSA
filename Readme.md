## 01-Fibonnaci Sequence

Given a number 'n' find the the first 'n' elements of the Fibonacci sequence.

In mathematics, the fibonnaci sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.

fibonnaci(2) = [0,1]

fibonnaci(3) = [0,1,1]

fibonnaci(4) = [0,1,1,2]

fibonnaci(7) = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]

## 02-Factorial of a number


Given an integer 'n', find the factorial of that interger.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer 'n', denoted n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'.

Factorial of Zero = 1

factorial(4) = 4*3*2*1 = 24

factorial(5) = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
