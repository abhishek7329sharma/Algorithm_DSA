## 01-Fibonnaci Sequence

Given a number 'n' find the the first 'n' elements of the Fibonacci sequence.

In mathematics, the fibonnaci sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.

fibonnaci(2) = [0,1]

fibonnaci(3) = [0,1,1]

fibonnaci(4) = [0,1,1,2]

fibonnaci(7) = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]

## 02-Factorial of a number


Given an integer 'n', find the factorial of that interger.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer 'n', denoted n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'.

Factorial of Zero = 1

factorial(4) = 4*3*2*1 = 24

factorial(5) = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120

## 03-Prime Number


Given an natural number 'n', determine if the number is prime or not.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

isPrime(5)=true (1*5 or 5*1)
isPrime(4)=fasle (1*4 or 2*2 or 4*1)

## 04-Power of Two


Given an positive integer 'n', determine if the number is a power of two or not.

An integer is a poer of two if there exists an integer `x` such that `n` === 2^x

isPowerOfTwo(1) = true (2^0)
isPowerOfTwo(2) = true (2^1)
isPowerOfTwo(5) = false

## 05-Recursion

### What?

- Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem

- Recursion is when a function calls itself

### Why?

- A great technique to simplify your solution

- If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful.

## 06-Recursion Fibonacci Sequence

- Give a number `n`, find the nth elment of the Fibonnacu sequence

- In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding onces.

- The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1 (0,1,1,2,3,5,8)

rescursiveFibonaaci(0) = 0
rescursiveFibonaaci(1) = 1
rescursiveFibonaaci(2) = 1
rescursiveFibonaaci(6) = 8
